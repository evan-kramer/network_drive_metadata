# Network Drive Metadata


## Problem
- We're running out of space on the network drive.
- It costs money to provision/maintain these servers.
- We're not sure what is taking up much of that space.

## Potential Solutions
- We can remove old files.
- We can zip together old versions.
- We can migrate files to other (lower-cost) locations (e.g., Teams SharePoint, etc.).

## Hangups
- We need to know what is taking up space, what is being used/accessed, and what we can safely remove.
